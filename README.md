I thought this would be a fun project to teach myself scala.

## Guide

Throughout the day, add tasks to the task file or typed through the cli and at the end of the day use the cli to complete your quests. PG will then give your player a reward based on the tasks completed for the day. You can then organize your spoils and equip your character for the next day.

Rewards are based on the difficulty of each task and what equipment you have.
Your tales of glory will be written in a journal (log) or directed to console.
For failed tasks, your player will take damage and lose resources based on the difficulty of the tasks unfinished and your current equipment.
